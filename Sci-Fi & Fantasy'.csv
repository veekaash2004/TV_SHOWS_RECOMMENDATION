Get a Life,"Get a Life is a television sitcom that was broadcast in the United States on the Fox Network from September 23, 1990, to March 8, 1992. The show stars Chris Elliott as a 30-year-old paperboy named Chris Peterson. Peterson lived in an apartment above his parents' garage. The opening credits depict Chris Peterson delivering newspapers on his bike to the show's theme song, ""Stand"" by R.E.M.

The show was a creation of Elliott, Adam Resnick and writer/director David Mirkin. Mirkin was executive producer/showrunner of the series and also directed most of the episodes. Notable writers of the series included Charlie Kaufman, screenwriter of Being John Malkovich; and Bob Odenkirk, co-creator of Mr. Show with Bob and David and Tenacious D.

The show was unconventional for a prime time sitcom, and many times the storylines of the episodes were surreal. For example, Elliott's character actually dies in twelve episodes. The causes of death included being crushed by a giant boulder, old age, tonsillitis, stab wounds, gunshot wounds, falling from an airplane, strangulation, getting run over by cars, choking on cereal, and simply exploding. For this reason, it was a struggle for Elliott and Mirkin to get the show on the air. Many of the executives at the Fox Network hated the show and thought it was too disturbing and that Elliott's character was too insane.",5030,https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/x5u3xjVAtOn5gCfOWXwXA8w9En1.jpg,7.6,15,False,[],[],"['Chris Elliott', 'Adam Resnick', 'David Mirkin']",[],1990,Sci-Fi & Fantasy Comedy,"['Life', 'television', 'sitcom', 'broadcast', 'United', 'States', 'Fox', 'Network', 'September', 'March', 'stars', 'Chris', 'Elliott', 'year', 'old', 'paperboy', 'named', 'Chris', 'Peterson', 'Peterson', 'lived', 'apartment', 'parents', 'garage', 'opening', 'credits', 'depict', 'Chris', 'Peterson', 'delivering', 'newspapers', 'bike', 'theme', 'song', 'Stand', 'creation', 'Elliott', 'Adam', 'Resnick', 'writer', 'director', 'David', 'Mirkin', 'Mirkin', 'executive', 'producer', 'showrunner', 'series', 'directed', 'episodes', 'Notable', 'writers', 'series', 'included', 'Charlie', 'Kaufman', 'screenwriter', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'Bob', 'Odenkirk', 'co', 'creator', 'Bob', 'David', 'Tenacious', 'unconventional', 'prime', 'time', 'sitcom', 'times', 'storylines', 'episodes', 'surreal', 'example', 'Elliott', 'character', 'actually', 'dies', 'episodes', 'causes', 'death', 'included', 'crushed', 'giant', 'boulder', 'old', 'age', 'tonsillitis', 'stab', 'wounds', 'gunshot', 'wounds', 'falling', 'airplane', 'strangulation', 'getting', 'run', 'cars', 'choking', 'cereal', 'simply', 'exploding', 'reason', 'struggle', 'Elliott', 'Mirkin', 'air', 'executives', 'Fox', 'Network', 'hated', 'thought', 'disturbing', 'Elliott', 'character', 'insane']",Sci-Fi & Fantasy Comedy  Life television sitcom broadcast United States Fox Network September March stars Chris Elliott year old paperboy named Chris Peterson Peterson lived apartment parents garage opening credits depict Chris Peterson delivering newspapers bike theme song Stand creation Elliott Adam Resnick writer director David Mirkin Mirkin executive producer showrunner series directed episodes Notable writers series included Charlie Kaufman screenwriter John Malkovich Bob Odenkirk co creator Bob David Tenacious unconventional prime time sitcom times storylines episodes surreal example Elliott character actually dies episodes causes death included crushed giant boulder old age tonsillitis stab wounds gunshot wounds falling airplane strangulation getting run cars choking cereal simply exploding reason struggle Elliott Mirkin air executives Fox Network hated thought disturbing Elliott character insane 7.6  Chris Elliott Adam Resnick David Mirkin  ,,

Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons,"Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons, often referred to as Captain Scarlet, is a 1960s British science-fiction television series produced by the Century 21 Productions company of Gerry and Sylvia Anderson, John Read and Reg Hill. First broadcast on ATV Midlands from September 1967 to May 1968, it has since been transmitted in more than 40 other countries, including the United States, Australia, New Zealand and Japan. Characters are presented as marionette puppets alongside scale model sets and special effects in a filming technique that the Andersons termed ""Supermarionation"". This technology incorporated solenoid motors as a means of synchronising the puppet's lip movements with pre-recorded dialogue.

Set in 2068, Captain Scarlet presents the hostilities between Earth and a race of Martians known as the Mysterons. After human astronauts attack their city on Mars, the vengeful Mysterons declare war on Earth, initiating a series of reprisals that are countered by Spectrum, a worldwide security organisation. Spectrum boasts the extraordinary abilities of its primary agent, Captain Scarlet.

Monsters,"Monsters is a syndicated horror anthology series which originally ran from 1988 to 1991 and reran on the Sci-Fi Channel during the 1990s. As of 2011, Monsters airs on NBC Universal's horror/suspense-themed cable channel Chiller in sporadic weekday marathons.

In a similar vein to Tales from the Darkside, Monsters shared the same producer, and in some ways succeeded the show. It differed in some respects nonetheless. While Tales sometimes dabbled in stories of science fiction and fantasy, this series was more strictly horror. As the name implies, each episode of Monsters featured a different monster which the story concerned, from the animatronic puppet of a fictional children's television program to mutated, weapon-wielding lab rats.

Similar to Tales, however, the stories in Monsters were rarely very straightforward action plots and often contained some ironic twist in which a character's conceit or greed would do him in, often with gruesome results. Adding to this was a sense of comedy often lost on horror productions which might in some instances lighten the audience's mood but in many cases added to the overall eeriness of the production.",6323,https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/fnBz19xGCKc7mfEo9NOeRWIe4iX.jpg,7.1,14,False,[],[],"['Richard P.

Todd and the Book of Pure Evil,"Todd and the Book of Pure Evil is a Canadian comedy/horror television series that follows a group of high school students who confront the effects of a demonic book. The series premiered on Space Channel on September 29, 2010 with two back-to-back episodes. The show was created for television by Craig David Wallace, Charles Picco, and Anthony Leo.

Todd and the Book of Pure Evil is based on the short film of the same title written by Craig David Wallace and Max Reid, and directed by Wallace. The short film was produced through the Canadian Film Centre’s Short Dramatic Film Programme, and kicked off an international festival tour by premiering at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2003. The series was developed for television through the National Screen Institute's Totally TV Program. A pilot for Todd and the Book of Pure Evil was shot for Space in 2009 in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Like the low-budget short film, the series uses supernatural elements, profanity, graphic violence and non-sequitur lines. Sci-fi veteran David Winning directed four episodes.

Each episode was produced with two variations of the audio track: a pre-watershed version with ""clean"" replacement dialogue dubbed in by the actors, and the original uncensored version with profanity.",32625,https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/qSEV3a6kA5aXnv9bj42I6IWXaR6.jpg,7.048,31,False,[],[],"['Craig David Wallace', 'Charles Picco', 'Anthony Leo']",[],2010,Comedy Sci-Fi & Fantasy,"['Todd', 'Book', 'Pure', 'Evil', 'Canadian', 'comedy', 'horror', 'television', 'series', 'follows', 'group', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'confront', 'effects', 'demonic', 'book', 'series', 'premiered', 'Space', 'Channel', 'September', 'episodes', 'created', 'television', 'Craig', 'David', 'Wallace', 'Charles', 'Picco', 'Anthony', 'Leo', 'Todd', 'Book', 'Pure', 'Evil', 'based', 'short', 'film', 'title', 'written', 'Craig', 'David', 'Wallace', 'Max', 'Reid', 'directed', 'Wallace', 'short', 'film', 'produced', 'Canadian', 'Film', 'Centre', 'Short', 'Dramatic', 'Film', 'Programme', 'kicked', 'international', 'festival', 'tour', 'premiering', 'Toronto', 'International', 'Film', 'Festival', 'series', 'developed', 'television', 'National', 'Screen', 'Institute', 'Totally', 'TV', 'Program', 'pilot', 'Todd', 'Book', 'Pure', 'Evil', 'shot', 'Space', 'Winnipeg', 'Manitoba', 'Like', 'low', 'budget', 'short', 'film', 'series', 'uses', 'supernatural', 'elements', 'profanity', 'graphic', 'violence', 'non', 'sequitur', 'lines', 'Sci', 'fi', 'veteran', 'David', 'Winning', 'directed', 'episodes', 'episode', 'produced', 'variations', 'audio', 'track', 'pre', 'watershed', 'version', 'clean', 'replacement', 'dialogue', 'dubbed', 'actors', 'original', 'uncensored', 'version', 'profanity']",Comedy Sci-Fi & Fantasy  Todd Book Pure Evil Canadian comedy horror television series follows group high school students confront effects demonic book series premiered Space Channel September episodes created television Craig David Wallace Charles Picco Anthony Leo Todd Book Pure Evil based short film title written Craig David Wallace Max Reid directed Wallace short film produced Canadian Film Centre Short Dramatic Film Programme kicked international festival tour premiering Toronto International Film Festival series developed television National Screen Institute Totally TV Program pilot Todd Book Pure Evil shot Space Winnipeg Manitoba Like low budget short film series uses supernatural elements profanity graphic violence non sequitur lines Sci fi veteran David Winning directed episodes episode produced variations audio track pre watershed version clean replacement dialogue dubbed actors original uncensored version profanity 7.048  Craig David Wallace Charles Picco Anthony Leo  ,,

The Invisible Man,"The Invisible Man is a Sci-Fi American television series starring Vincent Ventresca, Paul Ben-Victor, Eddie Jones, Shannon Kenny and Michael McCafferty. Somewhat more successful than previous television series involving invisible secret agents, it aired from June 9, 2000 to February 1, 2002, lasting two seasons.

The plot revolves around Darien Fawkes, a thief facing life imprisonment who was recruited by a low-rent spy organization and given the power of invisibility via implantation of a special ""Quicksilver gland"" in his head. The gland allows Fawkes to secrete a light-bending substance called ""Quicksilver"" from his pores and follicles. The substance quickly coats his skin, hair, nails and clothes and renders him invisible. He can consciously release the Quicksilver, which then flakes off and disintegrates. However, the Quicksilver gland was sabotaged at its creation by scientist Arnaud DeFehrn to release a neurotoxin that accumulates in the bloodstream and causes intense pain, followed by antisocial behavior and psychosis. The host requires regular doses of ""counteragent"" to keep him sane and healthy, which is controlled by said government agency. This series lasted for two seasons, before being cancelled due to cost issues and internal bickering between the Sci Fi Channel and its then-parent company, USA Networks.

O Beijo do Vampiro,"The struggling Lívia despairs when she learns that her husband, before dying, lost a fortune in shady deals. Widowed and with three children, she is forced to fight for her family and leaves for the paradisiacal beach town of Maramores, where her mother Zoroastra lives. Parallel to the difficulties, Lívia discovers that she is involved in the eternal struggle of Good against Evil.

In fact, Lívia is the reincarnation of Princess Cecília, the eternal passion of the vampire Bóris Vladescu, who has been pursuing her for centuries. The two met in 7th century Europe, when Bóris disputed the princess's love with Count Rogério. Nowadays, Rogério was Beto, Lívia's husband, and the two times he faced Boris, his arch-enemy, he took the worst.

Boris is in Maramores to get Cecilia, his immortal beloved. Or rather, Livia, who raises the boy Zeca, who she doesn't even suspect is actually a half-vampire, son of Boris. The vampire is willing to prepare his son to take his place, but Zeca is reluctant to accept his condition, much to his father's despair.

With Bóris comes a legion of vampires willing to terrorize the residents of the peaceful city. Among them, the splendid Mina, his wife, and the gallant Victor, who involves the sweet Ciça in a game of seduction. Vampires are closely watched by the flustered Galileo Van Burger, a vampire hunter who failed to prevent his wacky son Bartô from being bitten.

Who also keeps an eye on the vampires is the mystical Zoroastra, mother of Lívia, a modern witch, who owns the main inn in Maramores. And the mysterious Ezekiel, in reality an angel who came down to Earth to protect Lívia and Zeca from the evil that persecutes them.

Engineer Rodrigo also arrives in the city, followed by his ex-girlfriend Lara. The two are the first victims of vampires. Lara is bitten by Victor and becomes an evil vampire, due to her bad temper. Rodrigo is bitten by Mina, who becomes pregnant and is expecting a daughter from him, which she says is from Boris.

Meanwhile, Rodrigo is used by Boris to approach Lívia. Who does not like this involvement is Augusto, a friend of Lívia who has loved her in the past. Augusto is a widower who raises his small children with the help of sister-in-law Marta, a blind woman, but bitter and Machiavellian, who does everything to keep him from Lívia, because she loves him.",8335,https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/fQsnoRyA9Fd0Zw6AUldw4sxrYyR.jpg,6.429,7,False,[],[],['Antônio Calmon'],[],2002,Soap Sci-Fi & Fantasy Drama,"['struggling', 'Lívia', 'despairs', 'learns', 'husband', 'dying', 'lost', 'fortune', 'shady', 'deals', 'Widowed', 'children', 'forced', 'fight', 'family', 'leaves', 'paradisiacal', 'beach', 'town', 'Maramores', 'mother', 'Zoroastra', 'lives', 'Parallel', 'difficulties', 'Lívia', 'discovers', 'involved', 'eternal', 'struggle', 'Good', 'Evil', 'fact', 'Lívia', 'reincarnation', 'Princess', 'Cecília', 'eternal', 'passion', 'vampire', 'Bóris', 'Vladescu', 'pursuing', 'centuries', 'met', 'century', 'Europe', 'Bóris', 'disputed', 'princess', 'love', 'Count', 'Rogério', 'Nowadays', 'Rogério', 'Beto', 'Lívia', 'husband', 'times', 'faced', 'Boris', 'arch', 'enemy', 'took', 'worst', 'Boris', 'Maramores', 'Cecilia', 'immortal', 'beloved', 'Livia', 'raises', 'boy', 'Zeca', 'suspect', 'actually', 'half', 'vampire', 'son', 'Boris', 'vampire', 'willing', 'prepare', 'son', 'place', 'Zeca', 'reluctant', 'accept', 'condition', 'father', 'despair', 'Bóris', 'comes', 'legion', 'vampires', 'willing', 'terrorize', 'residents', 'peaceful', 'city', 'splendid', 'Mina', 'wife', 'gallant', 'Victor', 'involves', 'sweet', 'Ciça', 'game', 'seduction', 'Vampires', 'closely', 'watched', 'flustered', 'Galileo', 'Van', 'Burger', 'vampire', 'hunter', 'failed', 'prevent', 'wacky', 'son', 'Bartô', 'bitten', 'keeps', 'eye', 'vampires', 'mystical', 'Zoroastra', 'mother', 'Lívia', 'modern', 'witch', 'owns', 'main', 'inn', 'Maramores', 'mysterious', 'Ezekiel', 'reality', 'angel', 'came', 'Earth', 'protect', 'Lívia', 'Zeca', 'evil', 'persecutes', 'Engineer', 'Rodrigo', 'arrives', 'city', 'followed', 'ex', 'girlfriend', 'Lara', 'victims', 'vampires', 'Lara', 'bitten', 'Victor', 'evil', 'vampire', 'bad', 'temper', 'Rodrigo', 'bitten', 'Mina', 'pregnant', 'expecting', 'daughter', 'says', 'Boris', 'Rodrigo', 'Boris', 'approach', 'Lívia', 'like', 'involvement', 'Augusto', 'friend', 'Lívia', 'loved', 'past', 'Augusto', 'widower', 'raises', 'small', 'children', 'help', 'sister', 'law', 'Marta', 'blind', 'woman', 'bitter', 'Machiavellian', 'Lívia', 'loves']",Soap Sci-Fi & Fantasy Drama  struggling Lívia despairs learns husband dying lost fortune shady deals Widowed children forced fight family leaves paradisiacal beach town Maramores mother Zoroastra lives Parallel difficulties Lívia discovers involved eternal struggle Good Evil fact Lívia reincarnation Princess Cecília eternal passion vampire Bóris Vladescu pursuing centuries met century Europe Bóris disputed princess love Count Rogério Nowadays Rogério Beto Lívia husband times faced Boris arch enemy took worst Boris Maramores Cecilia immortal beloved Livia raises boy Zeca suspect actually half vampire son Boris vampire willing prepare son place Zeca reluctant accept condition father despair Bóris comes legion vampires willing terrorize residents peaceful city splendid Mina wife gallant Victor involves sweet Ciça game seduction Vampires closely watched flustered Galileo Van Burger vampire hunter failed prevent wacky son Bartô bitten keeps eye vampires mystical Zoroastra mother Lívia modern witch owns main inn Maramores mysterious Ezekiel reality angel came Earth protect Lívia Zeca evil persecutes Engineer Rodrigo arrives city followed ex girlfriend Lara victims vampires Lara bitten Victor evil vampire bad temper Rodrigo bitten Mina pregnant expecting daughter says Boris Rodrigo Boris approach Lívia like involvement Augusto friend Lívia loved past Augusto widower raises small children help sister law Marta blind woman bitter Machiavellian Lívia loves 6.429  Antônio Calmon  ,,

Is This a Zombie?,"Some guys have no luck; he’s got no pulse. That’s life for poor unfortunate, undead Ayumu. First, he was murdered by a serial killer. Total bummer. Then he was resurrected as a zombie by a cute little Necromancer. That seemed pretty cool until she moved into his house, refused to speak, and forced his rotting carcass to do all the cooking. After that, a magical girl in a pretty pink dress used her matching chainsaw to chop his corpse in half. Luckily, the Necromancer’s powers of resurrection trumped those of the chainsaw chick, so instead of dying (again), Ayumu became the world’s first magical girl zombie. There’s also a voluptuous vampire ninja who thinks zombie boy’s a pervert – and a hideous crayfish demon who wants to devour him. Confused?
