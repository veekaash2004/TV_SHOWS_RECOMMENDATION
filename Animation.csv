Science Ninja Team Gatchaman,"Science Ninja Team Gatchaman is a five-member superhero team that is composed of the main characters in several anime created by Tatsuo Yoshida and originally produced in Japan by Tatsunoko Productions and later adapted into several English-language versions. It is also known by the abbreviated name Gatchaman.

The original series, produced in 1972, was eponymously named Kagaku Ninja Tai Gatchaman and is most well known to the English-speaking world as the adaptation titled Battle of the Planets. The series received additional English adaptations with G-Force: Guardians of Space and ADV Films' uncut 2005 release. Tatsunoko also uses the official translation Science Commando Gatchaman, as shown in numerous related products and media. Because the English-language versions are notoriously inconsistent not only with one another but also with the original Japanese series, viewers most familiar with the English versions often experience some confusion upon re-examining the series after a long hiatus.

The original 1972 Kagaku Ninja Tai Gatchaman series was followed by an animated film, two sequel series, Gatchaman II, and Gatchaman Fighter. In the 90's, episodes from both series were dubbed into English by Saban as Eagle Riders. In 1994, the original series was remade as a condensed OVA series.",13549,https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/9qPFWl6LUbA18kBkV6Hi19Pi0Tf.jpg,8.5,70,False,[],[],['Tatsuo Yoshida'],[],1972,Animation,"['Science', 'Ninja', 'Team', 'Gatchaman', 'member', 'superhero', 'team', 'composed', 'main', 'characters', 'anime', 'created', 'Tatsuo', 'Yoshida', 'originally', 'produced', 'Japan', 'Tatsunoko', 'Productions', 'later', 'adapted', 'English', 'language', 'versions', 'known', 'abbreviated', 'Gatchaman', 'original', 'series', 'produced', 'eponymously', 'named', 'Kagaku', 'Ninja', 'Tai', 'Gatchaman', 'known', 'English', 'speaking', 'world', 'adaptation', 'titled', 'Battle', 'Planets', 'series', 'received', 'additional', 'English', 'adaptations', 'G', 'Force', 'Guardians', 'Space', 'ADV', 'Films', 'uncut', 'release', 'Tatsunoko', 'uses', 'official', 'translation', 'Science', 'Commando', 'Gatchaman', 'shown', 'numerous', 'related', 'products', 'media', 'English', 'language', 'versions', 'notoriously', 'inconsistent', 'original', 'Japanese', 'series', 'viewers', 'familiar', 'English', 'versions', 'experience', 'confusion', 'examining', 'series', 'long', 'hiatus', 'original', 'Kagaku', 'Ninja', 'Tai', 'Gatchaman', 'series', 'followed', 'animated', 'film', 'sequel', 'series', 'Gatchaman', 'II', 'Gatchaman', 'Fighter', 'episodes', 'series', 'dubbed', 'English', 'Saban', 'Eagle', 'Riders', 'original', 'series', 'remade', 'condensed', 'OVA', 'series']",Animation  Science Ninja Team Gatchaman member superhero team composed main characters anime created Tatsuo Yoshida originally produced Japan Tatsunoko Productions later adapted English language versions known abbreviated Gatchaman original series produced eponymously named Kagaku Ninja Tai Gatchaman known English speaking world adaptation titled Battle Planets series received additional English adaptations G Force Guardians Space ADV Films uncut release Tatsunoko uses official translation Science Commando Gatchaman shown numerous related products media English language versions notoriously inconsistent original Japanese series viewers familiar English versions experience confusion examining series long hiatus original Kagaku Ninja Tai Gatchaman series followed animated film sequel series Gatchaman II Gatchaman Fighter episodes series dubbed English Saban Eagle Riders original series remade condensed OVA series 8.5  Tatsuo Yoshida  ,,

"Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist","Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist is an American animated series that originally ran on Comedy Central from May 28, 1995 to December 24, 1999—with a final set of three shelved episodes airing in 2002—starring Jonathan Katz, Jon Benjamin, and Laura Silverman. The show was created by a Burbank, California production company Popular Arts Entertainment, with Jonathan Katz and Tom Snyder, developed and first made by Popular Arts for HBO Downtown Productions. Boston-based Tom Snyder Productions became the hands-on production company, and the episodes were usually produced by Katz and Loren Bouchard.

The show was computer animated in a crude, easily recognizable style produced with the software Squigglevision in which all persons and animate objects are colored and have constantly squiggling outlines, while most other inanimate objects are static and usually gray in color. The original challenge Popular Arts faced was how to repurpose recorded stand-up comedy material. To do so they based Dr. Katz's patients on stand-up comics for the first several episodes, simply having them recite their stand-up acts. The secondary challenge was how to affordably animate on cable TV at the time. Snyder had Squigglevision, an inexpensive means of getting animation on cable, which could not afford traditional animation processes. A partnership between Popular Arts, Tom Snyder Productions and Jonathan Katz was formed and Dr. Katz: Professional Therapist was born.",2513,https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/wHqJxW6vCi8g3ZZJnFEDGcMsaor.jpg,7.793,46,False,[],[],['Jonathan Katz'],[],1995,Animation Comedy,"['Katz', 'Professional', 'Therapist', 'American', 'animated', 'series', 'originally', 'ran', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'December', 'final', 'set', 'shelved', 'episodes', 'airing', 'starring', 'Jonathan', 'Katz', 'Jon', 'Benjamin', 'Laura', 'Silverman', 'created', 'Burbank', 'California', 'production', 'company', 'Popular', 'Arts', 'Entertainment', 'Jonathan', 'Katz', 'Tom', 'Snyder', 'developed', 'Popular', 'Arts', 'HBO', 'Downtown', 'Productions', 'Boston', 'based', 'Tom', 'Snyder', 'Productions', 'hands', 'production', 'company', 'episodes', 'usually', 'produced', 'Katz', 'Loren', 'Bouchard', 'computer', 'animated', 'crude', 'easily', 'recognizable', 'style', 'produced', 'software', 'Squigglevision', 'persons', 'animate', 'objects', 'colored', 'constantly', 'squiggling', 'outlines', 'inanimate', 'objects', 'static', 'usually', 'gray', 'color', 'original', 'challenge', 'Popular', 'Arts', 'faced', 'repurpose', 'recorded', 'stand', 'comedy', 'material', 'based', 'Katz', 'patients', 'stand', 'comics', 'episodes', 'simply', 'having', 'recite', 'stand', 'acts', 'secondary', 'challenge', 'affordably', 'animate', 'cable', 'TV', 'time', 'Snyder', 'Squigglevision', 'inexpensive', 'means', 'getting', 'animation', 'cable', 'afford', 'traditional', 'animation', 'processes', 'partnership', 'Popular', 'Arts', 'Tom', 'Snyder', 'Productions', 'Jonathan', 'Katz', 'formed', 'Katz', 'Professional', 'Therapist', 'born']",Animation Comedy  Katz Professional Therapist American animated series originally ran Comedy Central December final set shelved episodes airing starring Jonathan Katz Jon Benjamin Laura Silverman created Burbank California production company Popular Arts Entertainment Jonathan Katz Tom Snyder developed Popular Arts HBO Downtown Productions Boston based Tom Snyder Productions hands production company episodes usually produced Katz Loren Bouchard computer animated crude easily recognizable style produced software Squigglevision persons animate objects colored constantly squiggling outlines inanimate objects static usually gray color original challenge Popular Arts faced repurpose recorded stand comedy material based Katz patients stand comics episodes simply having recite stand acts secondary challenge affordably animate cable TV time Snyder Squigglevision inexpensive means getting animation cable afford traditional animation processes partnership Popular Arts Tom Snyder Productions Jonathan Katz formed Katz Professional Therapist born 7.793  Jonathan Katz  ,,

Metalocalypse,"Metalocalypse is an American animated television series, created by Brendon Small and Tommy Blacha, which premiered on August 6, 2006 on Adult Swim.

The show can be seen as both a parody and celebration of heavy metal culture.

The music, written by guitarist/creator Brendon Small, is credited to the band, and is featured in most of the episodes. The animation is often carefully synced to the music, with the chord positions and fingering of the guitar parts shown in some detail.

Celebrity Deathmatch,"Celebrity Deathmatch is a claymation television show that depicts celebrities against each other in a wrestling ring, almost always ending in the loser's gruesome death. It was known for its excessive amount of blood used in every match and exaggerated physical injuries.

The series was created by Eric Fogel; with the pilots airing on MTV on January 1 & 25 1998. The initial series ran from May 14, 1998 to October 20, 2002, and lasted for a 75-episode run. There was one special that did not contribute to the final episode total, entitled ""Celebrity Deathmatch Hits Germany"", which aired on June 21, 2001. Professional wrestler Stone Cold Steve Austin gave voice to his animated form as the guest commentator. Early in 2003, a film based on the series was announced by MTV to be in the making, but the project was canceled by the end of that year.

Devil Lady,"The beautiful and successful supermodel Jun Fudou meets a woman named Lan Asuka, who confronts her with a werewolf monster, which she calls a devil beast.

Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons,"Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons, often referred to as Captain Scarlet, is a 1960s British science-fiction television series produced by the Century 21 Productions company of Gerry and Sylvia Anderson, John Read and Reg Hill. First broadcast on ATV Midlands from September 1967 to May 1968, it has since been transmitted in more than 40 other countries, including the United States, Australia, New Zealand and Japan. Characters are presented as marionette puppets alongside scale model sets and special effects in a filming technique that the Andersons termed ""Supermarionation"". This technology incorporated solenoid motors as a means of synchronising the puppet's lip movements with pre-recorded dialogue.

Set in 2068, Captain Scarlet presents the hostilities between Earth and a race of Martians known as the Mysterons. After human astronauts attack their city on Mars, the vengeful Mysterons declare war on Earth, initiating a series of reprisals that are countered by Spectrum, a worldwide security organisation.

Because his unemployed parents are good-for-nothings who waste what money they have on gambling, Hayate had to start working at a young age to help out his family. Although such experience has made him inhumanly fast and tough and skilled at things boys aren't normally skilled at, it has also left him in an awkward position, as his parents have racked up such a huge gambling debt that they have sold Hayate to the yakuza for the value of his organs. In a desperate attempt to avoid that fate, Hayate decides to become a ""bad guy"" and kidnap someone to be held for ransom, but his efforts to do so are mistaken as a confession of love by the girl he targets. When he helps save the (as it turns out) ultra-wealthy 13-year-old Nagi from real kidnappers, she takes him in and gives him a job as her new personal butler (and love interest) until he can pay off his debt.

Oda Cinnamon Nobunaga,"Before he died at Honnouji in 1582, the great warlord Oda Nobunaga stood before a statue of Buddha and thought to himself that he'd committed so many sins that he'd very likely be reborn as a dog. He never expected that Buddha would take his words literally, however, but the next thing he's aware of, he's in the body of a Shiba Inu named Shinamon in modern Japan! Less than thrilled at the fact that his human warlord consciousness is trapped in the instinct-bound body of an adorable house pet, Nobunaga struggles between making the best of it (he can have that ruff all the Europeans were wearing!) and being frustrated with his reality (the ruff turns out to be a bath hat and now he has to have a bath).

The characters and plot were derived from the film, but the series could not replicate its success, efforts to make it consistent with real-world features were almost non-existent as, for example, Lake Titicaca is described as both puma-head shaped and as being found below the ruins of Macchu Picchu. The poor quality of the animation disappointed fans of the special effects-laden movie. It was retooled and rechristened The Mummy: Secrets of the Medjai for its second season, which began on February 15, 2003. Although the quality is considered to have improved between the first and second seasons, the show failed to find an audience and was cancelled on June 7, 2003. Reruns of the show aired on Toon Disney. The entire series was released on DVD in America R1 in three volumes on July 22, 2008.",5595,https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/buHYTfxH7QSd24jVftSc2JFMfQL.jpg,5.9,20,False,[],[],['Stephen Sommers'],[],2001,Animation Action & Adventure,"['Mummy', 'Animated', 'Series', 'animated', 'television', 'series', 'produced', 'Universal', 'Animation', 'Studios', 'capitalize', 'success', 'Mummy', 'premiered', 'Kids', 'WB', 'WB', 'network', 'September', 'set', 'characters', 'plot', 'derived', 'film', 'series', 'replicate', 'success', 'efforts', 'consistent', 'real', 'world', 'features', 'non', 'existent', 'example', 'Lake', 'Titicaca', 'described', 'puma', 'head', 'shaped', 'found', 'ruins', 'Macchu', 'Picchu', 'poor', 'quality', 'animation', 'disappointed', 'fans', 'special', 'effects', 'laden', 'movie', 'retooled', 'rechristened', 'Mummy', 'Secrets', 'Medjai', 'second', 'season', 'began', 'February', 'quality', 'considered', 'improved', 'second', 'seasons', 'failed', 'find', 'audience', 'cancelled', 'June', 'Reruns', 'aired', 'Toon', 'Disney', 'entire', 'series', 'released', 'DVD', 'America', 'volumes', 'July']",Animation Action & Adventure  Mummy Animated Series animated television series produced Universal Animation Studios capitalize success Mummy premiered Kids WB WB network September set characters plot derived film series replicate success efforts consistent real world features non existent example Lake Titicaca described puma head shaped found ruins Macchu Picchu poor quality animation disappointed fans special effects laden movie retooled rechristened Mummy Secrets Medjai second season began February quality considered improved second seasons failed find audience cancelled June Reruns aired Toon Disney entire series released DVD America volumes July 5.9  Stephen Sommers  ,,
