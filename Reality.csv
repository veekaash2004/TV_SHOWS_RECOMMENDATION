Aktenzeichen XY … ungelöst,"Aktenzeichen XY … ungelöst is a German television programme broadcast since October 1967 on ZDF that aims to combat and solve crimes. Until 2003 it was produced in co-operation with the Austrian public service broadcaster ORF and Schweizer Fernsehen, a division of the Swiss public broadcaster SRG SSR idée suisse. It was the basis for the BBC show Crimewatch, the Dutch show Opsporing Verzocht and its US equivalent America's Most Wanted.

The goal of the programme is to throw light on unsolved offences with the aid of viewers. Each episode contains three to five short films, each lasting about ten minutes, in which a real criminal case is reconstructed. The cases are mostly complex ones in which the criminals and chains of events are still unknown. In addition cases are discussed in the studio in which, for example, the identities of criminals or unknown murder victims are sought with the aid of a photo. Viewers can use the telephone or Internet to give information.

Every episode features between 50 and 60 clips of misadventure – ordinary folk making extraordinary mistakes. Each week watch stunts involving weightlifting, shooting guns or jumping over cars, that have gone wrong, paused, re-wound, and re-played and analysed to determine exactly what went wrong and why.

Extreme Makeover: Home Edition,"Extreme Makeover: Home Edition is an American reality television series providing home improvements for less fortunate families and community schools. The show is hosted by former model, carpenter and veteran television personality Ty Pennington.

Each episode features a family that has faced some sort of recent or ongoing hardship such as a natural disaster or a family member with a life-threatening illness, in need of new hope. The show's producers coordinate with a local construction contractor, which then coordinates with various companies in the building trades for a makeover of the family's home. This includes interior, exterior and landscaping, performed in seven days while the family is on vacation and documented in the episode. If the house is beyond repair, they replace it entirely. The show's producers and crew film set and perform the makeover but do not pay for it. The materials and labor are donated. Many skilled and unskilled volunteers assist in the rapid construction of the house.

EM:HE is considered a spinoff of Extreme Makeover, an earlier series providing personal makeovers to selected individuals, which the Home Edition has now outlasted. This show displays extreme changes to help recreate someone's space. However, the format differs considerably; in the original Extreme Makeover, for instance, participants were not necessarily chosen based on any recent hardship, whereas the family's backstory is an important component of Home Edition. EM:HE also has similarities to other home renovation series such as Trading Spaces, on which Pennington was previously a key personality.",721,https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/nM43UpAWF3Tleshq16N8vLsMhGr.jpg,6.6,45,False,[],[],[],[],2003,Reality,"['Extreme', 'Makeover', 'Home', 'Edition', 'American', 'reality', 'television', 'series', 'providing', 'home', 'improvements', 'fortunate', 'families', 'community', 'schools', 'hosted', 'model', 'carpenter', 'veteran', 'television', 'personality', 'Ty', 'Pennington', 'episode', 'features', 'family', 'faced', 'sort', 'recent', 'ongoing', 'hardship', 'natural', 'disaster', 'family', 'member', 'life', 'threatening', 'illness', 'need', 'new', 'hope', 'producers', 'coordinate', 'local', 'construction', 'contractor', 'coordinates', 'companies', 'building', 'trades', 'makeover', 'family', 'home', 'includes', 'interior', 'exterior', 'landscaping', 'performed', 'seven', 'days', 'family', 'vacation', 'documented', 'episode', 'house', 'repair', 'replace', 'entirely', 'producers', 'crew', 'film', 'set', 'perform', 'makeover', 'pay', 'materials', 'labor', 'donated', 'skilled', 'unskilled', 'volunteers', 'assist', 'rapid', 'construction', 'house', 'EM', 'considered', 'spinoff', 'Extreme', 'Makeover', 'earlier', 'series', 'providing', 'personal', 'makeovers', 'selected', 'individuals', 'Home', 'Edition', 'outlasted', 'displays', 'extreme', 'changes', 'help', 'recreate', 'space', 'format', 'differs', 'considerably', 'original', 'Extreme', 'Makeover', 'instance', 'participants', 'necessarily', 'chosen', 'based', 'recent', 'hardship', 'family', 'backstory', 'important', 'component', 'Home', 'Edition', 'EM', 'similarities', 'home', 'renovation', 'series', 'Trading', 'Spaces', 'Pennington', 'previously', 'key', 'personality']",Reality  Extreme Makeover Home Edition American reality television series providing home improvements fortunate families community schools hosted model carpenter veteran television personality Ty Pennington episode features family faced sort recent ongoing hardship natural disaster family member life threatening illness need new hope producers coordinate local construction contractor coordinates companies building trades makeover family home includes interior exterior landscaping performed seven days family vacation documented episode house repair replace entirely producers crew film set perform makeover pay materials labor donated skilled unskilled volunteers assist rapid construction house EM considered spinoff Extreme Makeover earlier series providing personal makeovers selected individuals Home Edition outlasted displays extreme changes help recreate space format differs considerably original Extreme Makeover instance participants necessarily chosen based recent hardship family backstory important component Home Edition EM similarities home renovation series Trading Spaces Pennington previously key personality 6.6    ,,
