Welcome to the N.H.K.,"Sato's life – or what's left of it – is a paranoid mess of conspiracy theories and social anxieties. He's terrified of the outside world; his apartment is overflowing with the remnants of cheap take-out food; and his retinas have been permanently scarred by a steady diet of internet porn.

She's ready to help him overcome his crippling phobias, but Sato would rather cower in his existential foxhole and pretend to work on the demo for his virtual sex game.

Cendrillon plots to rule both worlds, and searches for the ""key of Erde"" and the ""key of Phandavale"" which holds tremendous power.

A young boy from Erde by the name of Sōta meets a mysterious girl from Phandavale, Akazukin (Red Riding Hood), and her talking wolf companion, Val. Sōta learns that he is the key of Erde. Now it is up to Akazukin, Val, and the other Musketeers, Shirayukihime (Snow White) and Ibara (Sleeping Beauty) to protect Sōta from Cendrillon and her Nightmarians who wish to obtain the power he mysteriously possesses.",34212,https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/gQE6iyoamWNNvyu4rngwt1GsyBZ.jpg,8.0,2,False,[],[],[],[],2006,Sci-Fi & Fantasy Comedy Animation Action & Adventure,"['Long', 'long', 'ago', 'existed', 'world', 'magic', 'science', 'having', 'powers', 'making', 'people', 'conceited', 'lazy', 'God', 'split', 'world', 'world', 'science', 'Erde', 'German', 'Earth', 'world', 'magic', 'Phandavale', 'day', 'Phandavale', 'terrible', 'witch', 'named', 'Cendrillon', 'revives', 'Cendrillon', 'plots', 'rule', 'worlds', 'searches', 'key', 'Erde', 'key', 'Phandavale', 'holds', 'tremendous', 'power', 'young', 'boy', 'Erde', 'Sōta', 'meets', 'mysterious', 'girl', 'Phandavale', 'Akazukin', 'Red', 'Riding', 'Hood', 'talking', 'wolf', 'companion', 'Val', 'Sōta', 'learns', 'key', 'Erde', 'Akazukin', 'Val', 'Musketeers', 'Shirayukihime', 'Snow', 'White', 'Ibara', 'Sleeping', 'Beauty', 'protect', 'Sōta', 'Cendrillon', 'Nightmarians', 'wish', 'obtain', 'power', 'mysteriously', 'possesses']",Sci-Fi & Fantasy Comedy Animation Action & Adventure  Long long ago existed world magic science having powers making people conceited lazy God split world world science Erde German Earth world magic Phandavale day Phandavale terrible witch named Cendrillon revives Cendrillon plots rule worlds searches key Erde key Phandavale holds tremendous power young boy Erde Sōta meets mysterious girl Phandavale Akazukin Red Riding Hood talking wolf companion Val Sōta learns key Erde Akazukin Val Musketeers Shirayukihime Snow White Ibara Sleeping Beauty protect Sōta Cendrillon Nightmarians wish obtain power mysteriously possesses 8.0    ,,
Packed to the Rafters,"Packed to the Rafters is an Australian family-oriented television series which premiered on the Seven Network on Tuesday 26 August 2008 at 8:30 pm. The show has continued on Tuesdays in this timeslot for its entire run. The drama series features a mix of lighthearted comedy woven through the plot. It revolves around the Rafter family facing work pressures and life issues, whilst also tackling serious social issues. The Logie award winning series was the highest rating to screen on the Seven Network in 2008, and the show has consistently been among the top 5 shows of the year throughout its run in Australia.

It was announced in TV Week that the sixth season of Packed to the Rafters would be the last, with Hugh Sheridan stating: ""It's emotional letting go of Rafters – for all of us. It was such an amazing chapter in Aussie TV. I'm really proud we all came back together to send it off."" The two-hour series finale of Rafters aired on 2 July 2013, which saw the return of Hugh Sheridan, Jessica Marais, Ryan Corr, Jessica McNamee and James Stewart. Rebecca Gibney said, ""The cast, writers and producers have always said that we wanted to keep Rafters as one of the most-watched shows on TV. If we ever felt like we were losing too many cast members, we needed to end it on a high. We can say season six winds up an aspect of the Rafter family and there is a sense of finality to it.""",6754,https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/ux0DKkr9MFJzdAxYyigRwxyRUm8.jpg,8.0,6,False,[],[],['Bevan Lee'],[],2008,Drama Comedy,"['Packed', 'Rafters', 'Australian', 'family', 'oriented', 'television', 'series', 'premiered', 'Seven', 'Network', 'Tuesday', 'August', 'pm', 'continued', 'Tuesdays', 'timeslot', 'entire', 'run', 'drama', 'series', 'features', 'mix', 'lighthearted', 'comedy', 'woven', 'plot', 'revolves', 'Rafter', 'family', 'facing', 'work', 'pressures', 'life', 'issues', 'whilst', 'tackling', 'social', 'issues', 'Logie', 'award', 'winning', 'series', 'highest', 'rating', 'screen', 'Seven', 'Network', 'consistently', 'shows', 'year', 'run', 'Australia', 'announced', 'TV', 'Week', 'sixth', 'season', 'Packed', 'Rafters', 'Hugh', 'Sheridan', 'stating', 'emotional', 'letting', 'Rafters', 'amazing', 'chapter', 'Aussie', 'TV', 'proud', 'came', 'send', 'hour', 'series', 'finale', 'Rafters', 'aired', 'July', 'saw', 'return', 'Hugh', 'Sheridan', 'Jessica', 'Marais', 'Ryan', 'Corr', 'Jessica', 'McNamee', 'James', 'Stewart', 'Rebecca', 'Gibney', 'said', 'cast', 'writers', 'producers', 'said', 'wanted', 'Rafters', 'watched', 'shows', 'TV', 'felt', 'like', 'losing', 'cast', 'members', 'needed', 'end', 'high', 'season', 'winds', 'aspect', 'Rafter', 'family', 'sense', 'finality']",Drama Comedy  Packed Rafters Australian family oriented television series premiered Seven Network Tuesday August pm continued Tuesdays timeslot entire run drama series features mix lighthearted comedy woven plot revolves Rafter family facing work pressures life issues whilst tackling social issues Logie award winning series highest rating screen Seven Network consistently shows year run Australia announced TV Week sixth season Packed Rafters Hugh Sheridan stating emotional letting Rafters amazing chapter Aussie TV proud came send hour series finale Rafters aired July saw return Hugh Sheridan Jessica Marais Ryan Corr Jessica McNamee James Stewart Rebecca Gibney said cast writers producers said wanted Rafters watched shows TV felt like losing cast members needed end high season winds aspect Rafter family sense finality 8.0  Bevan Lee  ,,

Citizen James,"Citizen James is a BBC sitcom that ran for three series between 24 November 1960 and 23 November 1962. The show featured comedian and actor Sid James and Sydney Tafler with Bill Kerr and Liz Fraser appearing in early episodes. It was initially written by the comedy writing team of Galton and Simpson, who based the characters very much on the ""Sidney Balmoral James"" and ""Bill Kerr, the dim-witted Australian"" roles that they had played in Hancock's Half Hour.

The first series was set around 'Charlie's Nosh Bar', a cafe in Soho, and centred around Sid's get-rich-quick schemes. He is helped by ""Billy the Kerr"" and quite often frustrated by the local bookmaker Albert Welshman. Liz Fraser played Sid's long-suffering girlfriend who has been waiting for seven years for Sid to set the date.

Changes were made to the format after the first series. Sid James' character was changed to be something of a people's champion, campaigning for social justice. Bill Kerr and Liz Fraser departed and Sidney Tafler played a different character: Charlie Davenport. The location switched from Soho to Sid and Charlie sharing a house.

Full Dive: This Ultimate Next-Gen Full Dive RPG Is Even Shittier Than Real Life!,"In an unexpected turn of events, dull high school student Hiro Yuuki obtains the full dive role-playing game Kiwame Quest.

"Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist","Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist is an American animated series that originally ran on Comedy Central from May 28, 1995 to December 24, 1999—with a final set of three shelved episodes airing in 2002—starring Jonathan Katz, Jon Benjamin, and Laura Silverman. The show was created by a Burbank, California production company Popular Arts Entertainment, with Jonathan Katz and Tom Snyder, developed and first made by Popular Arts for HBO Downtown Productions. Boston-based Tom Snyder Productions became the hands-on production company, and the episodes were usually produced by Katz and Loren Bouchard.

The show was computer animated in a crude, easily recognizable style produced with the software Squigglevision in which all persons and animate objects are colored and have constantly squiggling outlines, while most other inanimate objects are static and usually gray in color. The original challenge Popular Arts faced was how to repurpose recorded stand-up comedy material. To do so they based Dr. Katz's patients on stand-up comics for the first several episodes, simply having them recite their stand-up acts.

Metalocalypse,"Metalocalypse is an American animated television series, created by Brendon Small and Tommy Blacha, which premiered on August 6, 2006 on Adult Swim.

The show can be seen as both a parody and celebration of heavy metal culture.

The music, written by guitarist/creator Brendon Small, is credited to the band, and is featured in most of the episodes. The animation is often carefully synced to the music, with the chord positions and fingering of the guitar parts shown in some detail.

The Andy Griffith Show,"The Andy Griffith Show is an American sitcom first televised on CBS between October 3, 1960 and April 1, 1968. Andy Griffith portrays the widowed sheriff of the fictional small community of Mayberry, North Carolina. His life is complicated by an inept, but well-meaning deputy, Barney Fife, a spinster aunt and housekeeper, Aunt Bee, and a precocious young son, Opie. Local ne'er-do-wells, bumbling pals, and temperamental girlfriends further complicate his life. Andy Griffith stated in a Today Show interview, with respect to the time period of the show: ""Well, though we never said it, and though it was shot in the '60s, it had a feeling of the '30s. It was when we were doing it, of a time gone by.""

The series never placed lower than seventh in the Nielsen ratings and ended its final season at number one. It has been ranked by TV Guide as the 9th-best show in American television history. Though neither Griffith nor the show won awards during its eight-season run, series co-stars Knotts and Bavier accumulated a combined total of six Emmy Awards. The show, a semi-spin-off from an episode of The Danny Thomas Show titled ""Danny Meets Andy Griffith"", spawned its own spin-off series, Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C., a sequel series, Mayberry R.F.D., and a reunion telemovie, Return to Mayberry. The show's enduring popularity has generated a good deal of show-related merchandise. Reruns currently air on TV Land, and the complete series is available on DVD.

Get a Life,"Get a Life is a television sitcom that was broadcast in the United States on the Fox Network from September 23, 1990, to March 8, 1992. The show stars Chris Elliott as a 30-year-old paperboy named Chris Peterson. Peterson lived in an apartment above his parents' garage. The opening credits depict Chris Peterson delivering newspapers on his bike to the show's theme song, ""Stand"" by R.E.M.

The show was a creation of Elliott, Adam Resnick and writer/director David Mirkin. Mirkin was executive producer/showrunner of the series and also directed most of the episodes. Notable writers of the series included Charlie Kaufman, screenwriter of Being John Malkovich; and Bob Odenkirk, co-creator of Mr. Show with Bob and David and Tenacious D.

The show was unconventional for a prime time sitcom, and many times the storylines of the episodes were surreal. For example, Elliott's character actually dies in twelve episodes. The causes of death included being crushed by a giant boulder, old age, tonsillitis, stab wounds, gunshot wounds, falling from an airplane, strangulation, getting run over by cars, choking on cereal, and simply exploding. For this reason, it was a struggle for Elliott and Mirkin to get the show on the air. Many of the executives at the Fox Network hated the show and thought it was too disturbing and that Elliott's character was too insane.",5030,https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/x5u3xjVAtOn5gCfOWXwXA8w9En1.jpg,7.6,15,False,[],[],"['Chris Elliott', 'Adam Resnick', 'David Mirkin']",[],1990,Sci-Fi & Fantasy Comedy,"['Life', 'television', 'sitcom', 'broadcast', 'United', 'States', 'Fox', 'Network', 'September', 'March', 'stars', 'Chris', 'Elliott', 'year', 'old', 'paperboy', 'named', 'Chris', 'Peterson', 'Peterson', 'lived', 'apartment', 'parents', 'garage', 'opening', 'credits', 'depict', 'Chris', 'Peterson', 'delivering', 'newspapers', 'bike', 'theme', 'song', 'Stand', 'creation', 'Elliott', 'Adam', 'Resnick', 'writer', 'director', 'David', 'Mirkin', 'Mirkin', 'executive', 'producer', 'showrunner', 'series', 'directed', 'episodes', 'Notable', 'writers', 'series', 'included', 'Charlie', 'Kaufman', 'screenwriter', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'Bob', 'Odenkirk', 'co', 'creator', 'Bob', 'David', 'Tenacious', 'unconventional', 'prime', 'time', 'sitcom', 'times', 'storylines', 'episodes', 'surreal', 'example', 'Elliott', 'character', 'actually', 'dies', 'episodes', 'causes', 'death', 'included', 'crushed', 'giant', 'boulder', 'old', 'age', 'tonsillitis', 'stab', 'wounds', 'gunshot', 'wounds', 'falling', 'airplane', 'strangulation', 'getting', 'run', 'cars', 'choking', 'cereal', 'simply', 'exploding', 'reason', 'struggle', 'Elliott', 'Mirkin', 'air', 'executives', 'Fox', 'Network', 'hated', 'thought', 'disturbing', 'Elliott', 'character', 'insane']",Sci-Fi & Fantasy Comedy  Life television sitcom broadcast United States Fox Network September March stars Chris Elliott year old paperboy named Chris Peterson Peterson lived apartment parents garage opening credits depict Chris Peterson delivering newspapers bike theme song Stand creation Elliott Adam Resnick writer director David Mirkin Mirkin executive producer showrunner series directed episodes Notable writers series included Charlie Kaufman screenwriter John Malkovich Bob Odenkirk co creator Bob David Tenacious unconventional prime time sitcom times storylines episodes surreal example Elliott character actually dies episodes causes death included crushed giant boulder old age tonsillitis stab wounds gunshot wounds falling airplane strangulation getting run cars choking cereal simply exploding reason struggle Elliott Mirkin air executives Fox Network hated thought disturbing Elliott character insane 7.6  Chris Elliott Adam Resnick David Mirkin  ,,

Riding the tide of the camp superhero craze of the 1960s, the show's premise involved gas station attendant Stanley Beamish, a mild-mannered scrawny youth who secretly worked to fight crime for a government organization, The Bureau of Secret Projects, in Washington. All he needed to do was take a ""power pill"" which gave him the strength of a thousand men and enabled him to fly, much like Superman, albeit by furious flapping while wearing the top half of a wingsuit. Unfortunately, he was the only person on whom the pills worked. It was established that, although the pill would give him great strength, he was still vulnerable to bullets. Furthermore, each power pill had a time limit of one hour, although he generally had two 10-minute booster pills available per episode. Much of the show's humor revolved around Stanley losing his superpowers before he completed his given assignment.",10611,https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/jrT2ydtTQkPf0x7gSU5QyErIfLv.jpg,7.3,5,False,[],[],[],[],1967,Comedy,"['Mister', 'Terrific', 'American', 'TV', 'sitcom', 'aired', 'CBS', 'Television', 'January', 'starred', 'Stephen', 'Strimpell', 'title', 'role', 'lasted', 'episodes', 'similar', 'NBC', 'Captain', 'Nice', 'followed', 'Mister', 'Terrific', 'Monday', 'nights', 'run', 'Riding', 'tide', 'camp', 'superhero', 'craze', 'premise', 'involved', 'gas', 'station', 'attendant', 'Stanley', 'Beamish', 'mild', 'mannered', 'scrawny', 'youth', 'secretly', 'worked', 'fight', 'crime', 'government', 'organization', 'Bureau', 'Secret', 'Projects', 'Washington', 'needed', 'power', 'pill', 'gave', 'strength', 'thousand', 'men', 'enabled', 'fly', 'like', 'Superman', 'albeit', 'furious', 'flapping', 'wearing', 'half', 'wingsuit', 'Unfortunately', 'person', 'pills', 'worked', 'established', 'pill', 'great', 'strength', 'vulnerable', 'bullets', 'Furthermore', 'power', 'pill', 'time', 'limit', 'hour', 'generally', 'minute', 'booster', 'pills', 'available', 'episode', 'humor', 'revolved', 'Stanley', 'losing', 'superpowers', 'completed', 'given', 'assignment']",Comedy  Mister Terrific American TV sitcom aired CBS Television January starred Stephen Strimpell title role lasted episodes similar NBC Captain Nice followed Mister Terrific Monday nights run Riding tide camp superhero craze premise involved gas station attendant Stanley Beamish mild mannered scrawny youth secretly worked fight crime government organization Bureau Secret Projects Washington needed power pill gave strength thousand men enabled fly like Superman albeit furious flapping wearing half wingsuit Unfortunately person pills worked established pill great strength vulnerable bullets Furthermore power pill time limit hour generally minute booster pills available episode humor revolved Stanley losing superpowers completed given assignment 7.3    ,,

Maverick,"Maverick is an American Western television series with comedic overtones created by Roy Huggins. The show ran from September 22, 1957 to July 8, 1962 on ABC and stars James Garner as Bret Maverick, an adroitly articulate cardsharp. Eight episodes into the first season, he was joined by Jack Kelly as his brother Bart, and from that point on, Garner and Kelly alternated leads from week to week, sometimes teaming up for the occasional two-brother episode. The Mavericks were poker players from Texas who traveled all over the American Old West and on Mississippi riverboats, constantly getting into and out of life-threatening trouble of one sort or another, usually involving money, women, or both. They would typically find themselves weighing a financial windfall against a moral dilemma. More often than not, their consciences trumped their wallets since both Mavericks were intensely ethical.

When Garner left the series after the third season due to a legal dispute, Roger Moore was added to the cast as their cousin Beau Maverick. Robert Colbert appeared later in the fourth season as a third Maverick brother, Brent Maverick. No more than two of the series leads ever appeared together in the same episode, and usually only one.",953,https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/psVbZjMHt9f9X7EIks9IQdCMZke.jpg,7.1,31,False,[],[],['Roy Huggins'],[],1957,Comedy Western,"['Maverick', 'American', 'Western', 'television', 'series', 'comedic', 'overtones', 'created', 'Roy', 'Huggins', 'ran', 'September', 'July', 'ABC', 'stars', 'James', 'Garner', 'Bret', 'Maverick', 'adroitly', 'articulate', 'cardsharp', 'episodes', 'season', 'joined', 'Jack', 'Kelly', 'brother', 'Bart', 'point', 'Garner', 'Kelly', 'alternated', 'leads', 'week', 'week', 'teaming', 'occasional', 'brother', 'episode', 'Mavericks', 'poker', 'players', 'Texas', 'traveled', 'American', 'Old', 'West', 'Mississippi', 'riverboats', 'constantly', 'getting', 'life', 'threatening', 'trouble', 'sort', 'usually', 'involving', 'money', 'women', 'typically', 'find', 'weighing', 'financial', 'windfall', 'moral', 'dilemma', 'consciences', 'trumped', 'wallets', 'Mavericks', 'intensely', 'ethical', 'Garner', 'left', 'series', 'season', 'legal', 'dispute', 'Roger', 'Moore', 'added', 'cast', 'cousin', 'Beau', 'Maverick', 'Robert', 'Colbert', 'appeared', 'later', 'fourth', 'season', 'Maverick', 'brother', 'Brent', 'Maverick', 'series', 'leads', 'appeared', 'episode', 'usually']",Comedy Western  Maverick American Western television series comedic overtones created Roy Huggins ran September July ABC stars James Garner Bret Maverick adroitly articulate cardsharp episodes season joined Jack Kelly brother Bart point Garner Kelly alternated leads week week teaming occasional brother episode Mavericks poker players Texas traveled American Old West Mississippi riverboats constantly getting life threatening trouble sort usually involving money women typically find weighing financial windfall moral dilemma consciences trumped wallets Mavericks intensely ethical Garner left series season legal dispute Roger Moore added cast cousin Beau Maverick Robert Colbert appeared later fourth season Maverick brother Brent Maverick series leads appeared episode usually 7.1  Roy Huggins  ,,

The opening and closing theme song from Late Night was also carried over to Tonight, in a slightly altered form.

In January 2010, after the show had been on the air for seven months, it was announced that NBC was intending to move Jay Leno from primetime back to his original timeslot at 11:35 pm, with O'Brien's show starting shortly after midnight.

He feared it would ruin the long and rich tradition of The Tonight Show. It had been on after the late local newscasts from the beginning.

The plot revolves around Darien Fawkes, a thief facing life imprisonment who was recruited by a low-rent spy organization and given the power of invisibility via implantation of a special ""Quicksilver gland"" in his head. The gland allows Fawkes to secrete a light-bending substance called ""Quicksilver"" from his pores and follicles. The substance quickly coats his skin, hair, nails and clothes and renders him invisible. He can consciously release the Quicksilver, which then flakes off and disintegrates. However, the Quicksilver gland was sabotaged at its creation by scientist Arnaud DeFehrn to release a neurotoxin that accumulates in the bloodstream and causes intense pain, followed by antisocial behavior and psychosis. The host requires regular doses of ""counteragent"" to keep him sane and healthy, which is controlled by said government agency. This series lasted for two seasons, before being cancelled due to cost issues and internal bickering between the Sci Fi Channel and its then-parent company, USA Networks.

It stars political humorist Stephen Colbert, a former correspondent for The Daily Show with Jon Stewart. The Colbert Report is a spin-off from and counterpart to The Daily Show that comments on politics and the media in a similar way.

Kath & Kim has garnered much critical acclaim since its debut, winning two Logie Awards, for ""Outstanding Comedy Programme"" and the ""Best Television Drama Series"" award at the Australian Film Institute Awards. In Australia, it has become a pop culture phenomenon, and is a success with audiences nationwide. Internationally, the series has spawned a cult fanbase, and in 2006 it was announced an American version of the series would be produced, to air on NBC. Riley and Turner served as executive producers on the US version. The American version was also picked up by Seven, which debuted the program on 12 October 2008, just three days after its debut in the United States.",1772,https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/mqjm2ZQ2U2bVsn76T3CKYru5e6t.jpg,6.8,10,False,[],[],"['Gina Riley', 'Jane Turner']",[],2002,Comedy,"['Kath', 'Kim', 'character', 'driven', 'Australian', 'television', 'situation', 'comedy', 'series', 'series', 'created', 'written', 'Jane', 'Turner', 'Gina', 'Riley', 'play', 'title', 'characters', 'suburban', 'mother', 'daughter', 'dysfunctional', 'relationship', 'series', 'main', 'characters', 'consist', 'Kath', 'Day', 'Knight', 'cheerful', 'year', 'old', 'woman', 'self', 'indulgent', 'daughter', 'Kim', 'Craig', 'Kath', 'boyfriend', 'second', 'husband', 'metrosexual', 'Kel', 'Knight', 'Kim', 'estranged', 'husband', 'Brett', 'Craig', 'lonely', 'overweight', 'second', 'best', 'friend', 'Sharon', 'Strzelecki', 'series', 'set', 'fictional', 'suburb', 'Fountain', 'Lakes', 'Melbourne', 'primarily', 'filmed', 'Patterson', 'Lakes', 'series', 'conceived', 'Turner', 'Riley', 'early', 'weekly', 'segment', 'Australian', 'comedy', 'series', 'Fast', 'Forward', 'skit', 'developed', 'series', 'series', 'Kath', 'Kim', 'premiered', 'ABC', 'TV', 'series', 'following', 'television', 'movie', 'entitled', 'Da', 'Kath', 'Kim', 'Code', 'broadcast', 'nationally', 'November', 'Kath', 'Kim', 'garnered', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'debut', 'winning', 'Logie', 'Awards', 'Outstanding', 'Comedy', 'Programme', 'Best', 'Television', 'Drama', 'Series', 'award', 'Australian', 'Film', 'Institute', 'Awards', 'Australia', 'pop', 'culture', 'phenomenon', 'success', 'audiences', 'nationwide', 'Internationally', 'series', 'spawned', 'cult', 'fanbase', 'announced', 'American', 'version', 'series', 'produced', 'air', 'NBC', 'Riley', 'Turner', 'served', 'executive', 'producers', 'version', 'American', 'version', 'picked', 'Seven', 'debuted', 'program', 'October', 'days', 'debut', 'United', 'States']",Comedy  Kath Kim character driven Australian television situation comedy series series created written Jane Turner Gina Riley play title characters suburban mother daughter dysfunctional relationship series main characters consist Kath Day Knight cheerful year old woman self indulgent daughter Kim Craig Kath boyfriend second husband metrosexual Kel Knight Kim estranged husband Brett Craig lonely overweight second best friend Sharon Strzelecki series set fictional suburb Fountain Lakes Melbourne primarily filmed Patterson Lakes series conceived Turner Riley early weekly segment Australian comedy series Fast Forward skit developed series series Kath Kim premiered ABC TV series following television movie entitled Da Kath Kim Code broadcast nationally November Kath Kim garnered critical acclaim debut winning Logie Awards Outstanding Comedy Programme Best Television Drama Series award Australian Film Institute Awards Australia pop culture phenomenon success audiences nationwide Internationally series spawned cult fanbase announced American version series produced air NBC Riley Turner served executive producers version American version picked Seven debuted program October days debut United States 6.8  Gina Riley Jane Turner  ,,

Most episodes are in the public domain.

Hayate the Combat Butler,"16-year-old Hayate is really down on his luck. Because his unemployed parents are good-for-nothings who waste what money they have on gambling, Hayate had to start working at a young age to help out his family. Although such experience has made him inhumanly fast and tough and skilled at things boys aren't normally skilled at, it has also left him in an awkward position, as his parents have racked up such a huge gambling debt that they have sold Hayate to the yakuza for the value of his organs. In a desperate attempt to avoid that fate, Hayate decides to become a ""bad guy"" and kidnap someone to be held for ransom, but his efforts to do so are mistaken as a confession of love by the girl he targets.

In ancient Egypt, an evil sorcerer named Scarab, kills the pharaoh's son, Prince Rapses, so he can become immortal.

Is This a Zombie?,"Some guys have no luck; he’s got no pulse. That’s life for poor unfortunate, undead Ayumu. First, he was murdered by a serial killer. Total bummer. Then he was resurrected as a zombie by a cute little Necromancer. That seemed pretty cool until she moved into his house, refused to speak, and forced his rotting carcass to do all the cooking. After that, a magical girl in a pretty pink dress used her matching chainsaw to chop his corpse in half. Luckily, the Necromancer’s powers of resurrection trumped those of the chainsaw chick, so instead of dying (again), Ayumu became the world’s first magical girl zombie.

Saved by the Bell: The New Class,"Saved by the Bell: The New Class is a spin-off of the Saved by the Bell series which ran from September 11, 1993 to January 8, 2000. The series lasted for seven seasons on NBC as a part of the network's TNBC Saturday morning line-up. It was the fourth incarnation of the franchise.

The show had the same concept as the original series but featured a new group of students now roaming the halls of the fictional Bayside High School. Mr. Belding, played by Dennis Haskins, remained as the school's principal. Many of the stories were recycled plots of its parent series.

Unlike the original series, which featured very few major cast changes throughout its run, The New Class regularly changed its core cast with Mr. Belding being the only constant factor.

The Dean Martin Celebrity Roasts,"The Dean Martin Celebrity Roasts is a NBC television special show hosted by entertainer Dean Martin from 1974 to 1984. For a series of 54 specials and shows, Martin would periodically ""roast"" a celebrity. These roasts were patterned after the roasts held at the New York Friars' Club in New York City. The format would have the celebrity guest seated at a banquet table, and one by one the guest of honor was affectionately chided or insulted about his career by his fellow celebrity friends.

In 1973, The Dean Martin Show was declining in popularity. The final season of his variety show would be retooled into one of celebrity roasts, requiring less of Martin's involvement. For the 1973–1974 season, a new feature called “Man of the Week Celebrity Roast"" was added to try to pick up the ratings. The roasts seemed to be popular among television audiences and are often marketed in post-issues as part of the official Dean Martin Celebrity Roasts and not The Dean Martin Show. After The Dean Martin Show was cancelled in 1974, NBC drew up a contract with Martin to do several specials and do more roast specials. Starting with Bob Hope in 1974, the roast was taped in California and turned out to be a hit, leading to many other roasts to follow.",39571,https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/wR5dGJxYPlPoElcXCxsxchRO8b9.jpg,4.75,8,False,[],[],[],[],1973,Comedy,"['Dean', 'Martin', 'Celebrity', 'Roasts', 'NBC', 'television', 'special', 'hosted', 'entertainer', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'series', 'specials', 'shows', 'Martin', 'periodically', 'roast', 'celebrity', 'roasts', 'patterned', 'roasts', 'held', 'New', 'York', 'Friars', 'Club', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'format', 'celebrity', 'guest', 'seated', 'banquet', 'table', 'guest', 'honor', 'affectionately', 'chided', 'insulted', 'career', 'fellow', 'celebrity', 'friends', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'declining', 'popularity', 'final', 'season', 'variety', 'retooled', 'celebrity', 'roasts', 'requiring', 'Martin', 'involvement', 'season', 'new', 'feature', 'called', 'Man', 'Week', 'Celebrity', 'Roast', 'added', 'try', 'pick', 'ratings', 'roasts', 'popular', 'television', 'audiences', 'marketed', 'post', 'issues', 'official', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'Celebrity', 'Roasts', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'cancelled', 'NBC', 'drew', 'contract', 'Martin', 'specials', 'roast', 'specials', 'Starting', 'Bob', 'Hope', 'roast', 'taped', 'California', 'turned', 'hit', 'leading', 'roasts', 'follow']",Comedy  Dean Martin Celebrity Roasts NBC television special hosted entertainer Dean Martin series specials shows Martin periodically roast celebrity roasts patterned roasts held New York Friars Club New York City format celebrity guest seated banquet table guest honor affectionately chided insulted career fellow celebrity friends Dean Martin declining popularity final season variety retooled celebrity roasts requiring Martin involvement season new feature called Man Week Celebrity Roast added try pick ratings roasts popular television audiences marketed post issues official Dean Martin Celebrity Roasts Dean Martin Dean Martin cancelled NBC drew contract Martin specials roast specials Starting Bob Hope roast taped California turned hit leading roasts follow 4.75    ,,

BBC Television Shakespeare,"The BBC Television Shakespeare is a series of British television adaptations of the plays of William Shakespeare, created by Cedric Messina and produced by BBC Television. It was transmitted in the UK from 3 December 1978 to 27 April 1985 and spanned seven series. Development of the series began in 1975 when Messina saw that Glamis Castle would make a perfect location for an adaptation of Shakespeare's play As You Like It.

Delta,"Delta is a short-lived U.S television sitcom series produced by ABC starring Delta Burke. Burke plays a woman who leaves her life behind to pursue her dream as a country music singer. Burke, most popular for her role as Suzanne Sugarbaker in the popular CBS sitcom Designing Women, reportedly utilized her own singing talents for the role of Bishop, and dyed her familiar brunette hair blonde to play the role. The series premiered September 15, 1992, to healthy ratings following the ABC blockbuster Roseanne. The series then moved to Thursday nights opposite FOX's The Simpsons, and ratings began to sink. The show was pulled from the schedule and returned to ABC the following Spring for six episodes before finally being canceled. In an attempt to infuse ratings, Burke brought her brunette hair back that spring, in the sake of familiarity, but it did little to save the series.

The theme song for the show was Reba McEntire's 'Climb That Mountain High' which was not a charted Reba single. The tune appears on the 1990 MCA album Rumor Has It.

The show received one Golden Globe Award nomination, to co-star Earl Holliman for ""Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role in a TV-Series"".",2363,https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/99bFCPbyJ6QS3evTSx5RzVuYvH.jpg,0.0,0,False,[],[],[],[],1992,Comedy,"['Delta', 'short', 'lived', 'television', 'sitcom', 'series', 'produced', 'ABC', 'starring', 'Delta', 'Burke', 'Burke', 'plays', 'woman', 'leaves', 'life', 'pursue', 'dream', 'country', 'music', 'singer', 'Burke', 'popular', 'role', 'Suzanne', 'Sugarbaker', 'popular', 'CBS', 'sitcom', 'Designing', 'Women', 'reportedly', 'utilized', 'singing', 'talents', 'role', 'Bishop', 'dyed', 'familiar', 'brunette', 'hair', 'blonde', 'play', 'role', 'series', 'premiered', 'September', 'healthy', 'ratings', 'following', 'ABC', 'blockbuster', 'Roseanne', 'series', 'moved', 'Thursday', 'nights', 'opposite', 'FOX', 'Simpsons', 'ratings', 'began', 'sink', 'pulled', 'schedule', 'returned', 'ABC', 'following', 'Spring', 'episodes', 'finally', 'canceled', 'attempt', 'infuse', 'ratings', 'Burke', 'brought', 'brunette', 'hair', 'spring', 'sake', 'familiarity', 'little', 'save', 'series', 'theme', 'song', 'Reba', 'McEntire', 'Climb', 'Mountain', 'High', 'charted', 'Reba', 'single', 'tune', 'appears', 'MCA', 'album', 'Rumor', 'received', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'Award', 'nomination', 'co', 'star', 'Earl', 'Holliman', 'Best', 'Performance', 'Actor', 'Supporting', 'Role', 'TV', 'Series']",Comedy  Delta short lived television sitcom series produced ABC starring Delta Burke Burke plays woman leaves life pursue dream country music singer Burke popular role Suzanne Sugarbaker popular CBS sitcom Designing Women reportedly utilized singing talents role Bishop dyed familiar brunette hair blonde play role series premiered September healthy ratings following ABC blockbuster Roseanne series moved Thursday nights opposite FOX Simpsons ratings began sink pulled schedule returned ABC following Spring episodes finally canceled attempt infuse ratings Burke brought brunette hair spring sake familiarity little save series theme song Reba McEntire Climb Mountain High charted Reba single tune appears MCA album Rumor received Golden Globe Award nomination co star Earl Holliman Best Performance Actor Supporting Role TV Series 0.0    ,,
