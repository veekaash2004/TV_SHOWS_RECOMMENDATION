The following September, America's Most Wanted's host, John Walsh, announced that the program would resume on the cable network Lifetime later that year.

Presented by Walsh, the show's purpose is to profile and assist law enforcement in the apprehension of fugitives wanted for numerous crimes, including murder, rape, kidnapping, child molestation, white-collar crime, organized crime, armed robbery, gang violence, and terrorism, and also many of whom are currently on the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list. On May 2, 2008, the program's website announced its 1,000th capture; as of March 30, 2013, 1,202 people have been captured because of AMW. Many of the series' cases have some connection outside the United States or have not taken place in the United States at all. The series' first international capture was in Nova Scotia in 1989.

It stars political humorist Stephen Colbert, a former correspondent for The Daily Show with Jon Stewart. The Colbert Report is a spin-off from and counterpart to The Daily Show that comments on politics and the media in a similar way. It satirizes conservative personality-driven political pundit programs, particularly Fox News' The O'Reilly Factor. The show focuses on a fictional anchorman character named Stephen Colbert, played by his real-life namesake. The character, described by Colbert as a ""well-intentioned, poorly informed, high-status idiot"", is a caricature of televised political pundits.

The Colbert Report has been nominated for seven Primetime Emmy Awards each in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012, two Television Critics Association Awards Awards, and two Satellite Awards. In 2013, it won two Emmys. It has been presented as non-satirical journalism in several instances, including by the Tom DeLay Legal Defense Trust and by Robert Wexler following his interview on the program.

This Hour Has 22 Minutes,"This Hour Has 22 Minutes is a weekly Canadian television comedy that airs on CBC Television. Launched in 1993 during Canada's 35th general election, the show focuses on Canadian politics, combining news parody, sketch comedy and satirical editorials. Originally featuring Cathy Jones, Rick Mercer, Greg Thomey and Mary Walsh, the series featured satirical sketches of the weekly news and Canadian political events. The show's format is a mock news program, intercut with comic sketches, parody commercials and humorous interviews of public figures. The on-location segments are frequently filmed with slanted camera angles.

Its full name is a parody of This Hour Has Seven Days, a CBC newsmagazine from the 1960s; the ""22 Minutes"" refers to the fact that a half-hour television program in Canada and the U.S. is typically 22 minutes long with eight minutes of commercials.

Jones and Walsh had previously worked together on the sketch comedy series CODCO, on which Thomey sometimes appeared as a guest.

Meet the Press,"Meet the Press is a weekly American television news/interview program airing on NBC. It is the longest-running television series in American broadcasting history, despite bearing little resemblance to the original format of the program seen in its television debut on November 6, 1947. Meet the Press is the highest-rated of the American television Sunday morning talk shows.

It has been hosted by 11 moderators, beginning with Martha Rountree. The current host is David Gregory, who assumed the role in December 2008. The show began using a new set on May 2, 2010, with video screens and a library-style set with bookshelves, and different, modified intro music, with David Gregory previewing the guests using a large video screen, and with the Meet the Press theme music in a shorter ""modernized [style]... the beginning repeated with drum beats"". Meet the Press and similar shows specialize in interviewing national leaders on issues of politics, economics, foreign policy and other public affairs.

Over the past few years, the program's usual time slot over the NBC network is between 9-10 a.m. local time in most markets, though this may vary by markets due to commitments by affiliates to religious, E/I or local news and public affairs programming. It also varies several weeks in the summer due to morning coverage of French Open tennis or the Monaco Grand Prix by NBC Sports. In earlier years, the program would air at noon every Sunday. The program also re-airs Sunday afternoons at 2 p.m. ET and early Monday mornings at 4 a.m. ET on MSNBC, along with an early Monday morning replay as part of NBC's ""All Night"" lineup. The program is also distributed to radio stations via syndication by Dial Global, and aired as part of C-SPAN Radio's replay of the Sunday morning talk shows.",4496,https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/jwzlIbqXhRsEwM1VuzLVOSrdJ8z.jpg,3.0,9,False,[],[],"['Martha Rountree', 'Lawrence E.

Striscia la Notizia,"Striscia la notizia is an Italian television program on the Mediaset-controlled Canale 5. Its name in Italian translates as ""the news slithers"", a probable parody of the slighting Italian journalist, submitted to politicians and overwhelmed with shame. The polysemic term Striscia, in English strip, can recall both a line of cocaine and the comic strip. But Striscia is also the slithing snake: this show worm in the hidden holes to unmask the television cheats. Founded in 1988, it is meant to be a parody of the daily news, which airs right before the program, but Striscia also satirizes government corruption and exposes scams with the help of local reporters who are also comedians. The program is directed and produced by Antonio Ricci and is hosted by two major comedians. Usually Ezio Greggio is assisted by another comedian for the winter season, after which there is a change of guard.",9237,https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/x4QByhE7lOMtUTi32xWSqoOHenD.jpg,0.0,0,False,[],[],['Antonio Ricci'],[],1988,Comedy News,"['Striscia', 'la', 'notizia', 'Italian', 'television', 'program', 'Mediaset', 'controlled', 'Canale', 'Italian', 'translates', 'news', 'slithers', 'probable', 'parody', 'slighting', 'Italian', 'journalist', 'submitted', 'politicians', 'overwhelmed', 'shame', 'polysemic', 'term', 'Striscia', 'English', 'strip', 'recall', 'line', 'cocaine', 'comic', 'strip', 'Striscia', 'slithing', 'snake', 'worm', 'hidden', 'holes', 'unmask', 'television', 'cheats', 'Founded', 'meant', 'parody', 'daily', 'news', 'airs', 'right', 'program', 'Striscia', 'satirizes', 'government', 'corruption', 'exposes', 'scams', 'help', 'local', 'reporters', 'comedians', 'program', 'directed', 'produced', 'Antonio', 'Ricci', 'hosted', 'major', 'comedians', 'Usually', 'Ezio', 'Greggio', 'assisted', 'comedian', 'winter', 'season', 'change', 'guard']",Comedy News  Striscia la notizia Italian television program Mediaset controlled Canale Italian translates news slithers probable parody slighting Italian journalist submitted politicians overwhelmed shame polysemic term Striscia English strip recall line cocaine comic strip Striscia slithing snake worm hidden holes unmask television cheats Founded meant parody daily news airs right program Striscia satirizes government corruption exposes scams help local reporters comedians program directed produced Antonio Ricci hosted major comedians Usually Ezio Greggio assisted comedian winter season change guard 0.0  Antonio Ricci  ,,
